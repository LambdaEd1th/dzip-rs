# dzip-rs

A high-performance Rust implementation of the Dzip archive format tool.
This project provides both a robust core library (`dzip-core`) and a feature-rich command-line interface (`dzip-cli`) for handling Dzip archives.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Built with Rust and optimized for speed.
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes multi-threading (`rayon`) for packing, unpacking, and verification, ensuring maximum throughput.
- **Multi-Volume Support**: Seamlessly handles split archives (e.g., `archive.dz`, `archive01.dz`, ...).
- **Compression Support**:
    - **Cloud/Distributed**: Zlib, Bzip2, LZMA.
    - **Specialized**: Zero (Run-length), Copy (Store), Combuf.
- **Robust Verification**: Integrity checking for all chunks, including cross-validation of chunk headers and data.
- **User Friendly**:
    - Progress bars for long-running operations.
    - Automatic config generation (`pack.toml`) during unpacking for easy repackaging.

## Installation

Ensure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dzip-rs.git
cd dzip-rs

# Build release version
cargo build --release
```

The executable will be located at `target/release/dzip-cli`.

## Usage

### Unpack
Extracts an archive to a specified directory.

```bash
dzip-cli unpack <INPUT_FILE> [OUTPUT_DIR]
```

Example:
```bash
dzip-cli unpack game_data.dz ./extracted_data
```
*   Helper: Generates a `game_data.toml` in the output directory, which can be used to repack the files later.

### Verify
Verifies the integrity of an archive.

```bash
dzip-cli verify <INPUT_FILE>
```

Example:
```bash
dzip-cli verify game_data.dz
```
*   Displays a detailed table of all chunks, including their status (OK/FAIL), size, compression method, and path.
*   checks all split volumes if present.

### Pack
Creates a Dzip archive from a configuration file.

```bash
dzip-cli pack <CONFIG_FILE> [-o OUTPUT_DIR]
```

Example:
```bash
dzip-cli pack extracted_data/game_data.toml -o ./new_build
```
*   Reads the TOML config (generated by `unpack` or created manually).
*   Compresses files in parallel.
*   Writes the .dz file (and volumes if configured) to the output directory.
